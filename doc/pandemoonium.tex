\section{What is Pandemoonium}

You take the role of a farmer, competing against other farmers, trying to get as much milk as possible in one day. A day is subdivided into rounds. Each cow can produce a fixed amount of milk per round. In each round, each farmer simultanously chooses a cow to milk. If more than one farmer selects the same cow, they subdivide the milk evenly (rounded down to the next largest integer -- fighting causes spillage!). At the end of the day, the farmer with the most milk is the winner.
